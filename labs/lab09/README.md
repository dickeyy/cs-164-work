# Lab09 Broken EReader
For this lab, you will be building the functionality for an EReader that has been dropped on the ground too many times. It holds all of the basic functionality
of an ereader, but a large part of the screen is blacked out, so it can only display one line of a book at a time.
# Step 1 -- Writing the Methods
For this lab, you will be expected to complete the following methods:
- loadBook(String book)
- displayLine()
- openBook()

For instructions on completing these methods, see the [Javadoc](https://csu-compsci-cs163-4.github.io/Lab09BrokenEReader/).
When working with your code for this lab, make sure the main method stays the same as it does in the provided copy. The Zybooks tests will test some input, and expects the main to look as it does when you get it.

# Step 2 -- Testing
Make sure to test your work. Some of the methods are tested for you in main, but be sure to add your own tests!
For this lab, running main will allow you to run go(), which should call your methods. Try playing around with the input to make sure it's doing what it should be.

# Step 3 -- Turning It In
Once you're done writing and testing the methods, go ahead and submit your files to Zybooks!
