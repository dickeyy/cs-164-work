## Lab 14 - CookiePizzaOrder
 
## Scenario 
Your boss was impressed with your work again! This week you will add methods to add cookie pizzas to orders. Because cookie pizzas are similar to pizzas, we will be using
inheritance.

Here is an example of the new receipts with dessert pizzas:

```text
--------------------
PIZZA          14.46
              ONIONS
        BELL PEPPERS
             SAUSAGE
--------------------
PIZZA          11.48
           ANCHOVIES
--------------------
PIZZA           8.99
        STRAWBERRIES
      CHOCOLATE CHIP
--------------------
SALAD           8.50
               SMALL
               RANCH
--------------------
TOTAL:         43.43
--------------------
```

## Step 1: Getting Started
Take a look at the [javadoc](https://csu-compsci-cs163-4.github.io/Lab14CookiePizzaOrder/) and take note of what methods you need 
to create from scratch, which ones you need to modify from Lab 12, and which ones you already did and don't need to change. Be sure to copy your code over from Lab12 before you begin. You will have to edit a new file, `CookiePizza`, as well as modify `CustomerOrder` to handle the creation of Cookie Pizzas and the printing of receipts.

## Step 2: Implementation
Follow the [javadoc](https://csu-compsci-cs163-4.github.io/Lab14CookiePizzaOrder/) and write some code. Make sure to write tests for your code as you work on 
each method.

## Step 3: Finishing up
To turn in your assignment, click through the link on Canvas, upload your files to Zybooks and click submit for grading. Note you can do this more than once.
