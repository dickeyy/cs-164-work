# Lab11 Modded Broken EReader
For this lab, you will be building on Lab 9. To start, transfer your work from the lab 9 methods into the new copy of EReader.java.

# Step 0 -- Copy Over Code from Lab9
This is an extension of lab 9, so make sure to copy your code over where appropriate to avoid any issues.

# Step 1 -- Writing the Methods
For this lab, you will be expected to complete the following methods:
- mathReader(String outputFile)
- mathHelper(String equation)

For instructions on completing these methods, see the [Javadoc](https://csu-compsci-cs163-4.github.io/Lab11ModdedBrokenEreader/).

# Step 2 -- Testing
Make sure to test your work. Some of the methods are tested for you in main, but be sure to add your own tests!
For this lab, running main will allow you to run go(), which should call your methods. Try playing around with the input to make sure it's doing what it should be.

# Step 3 -- Turning It In
Once you're done writing and testing the methods, go ahead and submit your files to Zybooks!
