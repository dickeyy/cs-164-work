# Lab 16 - More Recursion
For this lab you will implement three more recursive methods, which should more difficult than the last set that we worked through.

For ease of acces, here is the [javadoc](https://csu-compsci-cs163-4.github.io/Lab16MoreRecursion/package-summary.html).

## Pre-Step: Walkthrough & Compilation
Once again with this Tuesday lab, you are only tasked with creating self-explanations along with implementing their associated methods.

The general program structure is the same as the last recursion lab, but it may help to do another walkthrough to refresh your memory on how this program executes. The program should compile and run at the moment, but once you run it once hop over to you self-explanations.

## Step 1: Self-Explanation
There are only three self-explanations to complete for this lab. The first two are quite easy in comparison to the last method, so for the last method it will help your understanding if you draw out the program execution or pseudo-code along with your explanation. It may also help to focus specifically on your base and recursive cases when detailing your explanation.

Remember that this is a recursive lab, so you should **not** use loops for your explanations or implementations.

## Step 2: Implementation
After completing you explanations, all that is left is to move on to your implementations, the javadocs will be essential to creating these methods.

You can use the `main` driver file to test out your implementations, or you can go as far as creating a new class to test out any possible case of input for these methods.

## Step 3: Turning In
As with all Tuesday labs, check you self-explanations in with your TA and then you can upload your `MoreRecursionHelper.java` to zyBooks for your lab grade.

If you find yourself getting stumped with the last method, there are some similar examples within the zyBooks reading, if those don't help out the TA's are always willing to help!
