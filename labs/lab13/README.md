# Lab13 ZooZone
For this lab, you will be building on your work from Lab05. 
# Step 1 -- Writing the Methods
For this lab, you will be expected to complete the following methods:

Moving.java:
  - movingBoxes(String filename)
  - headCount()

For instructions on completing these methods, see the [Javadoc](https://csu-compsci-cs163-4.github.io/Lab13ZooZone/).

# Step 2 -- Testing
Make sure to test your work. Some of the methods are tested for you in main, but be sure to add your own tests!

# Step 3 -- Turning It In
Once you're done writing and testing the methods, go ahead and submit your files to Zybooks!
