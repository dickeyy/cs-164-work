## Lab 12 - SaladOrder
 
## Scenario 
Your boss was impressed with your work last week. This week you will add methods to add salads to orders and to make files that contain the receipts you created.

Here is an example of the new receipts with salads:

```text
--------------------
PIZZA          12.97
           PEPPERONI
            TOMATOES
--------------------
PIZZA          14.46
              SALAMI
           MUSHROOMS
              OLIVES
--------------------
SALAD          10.50
              MEDIUM
               RANCH
--------------------
TOTAL:         37.93
--------------------
```

## Step 1: Getting Started
Take a look at the [javadoc](https://csu-compsci-cs163-4.github.io/Lab12SaladOrder/) and take note of what methods you need 
to create from scratch, which ones you need to modify from Lab 10, and which ones you already did and don't need to change. Be sure to transfer your code from Lab 10 before you begin. You will have to modify new file `Salad` for the lab to create Salad objects as well as modify `CustomerOrder` to handle the creation of Salads and the printing of receipts.

## Step 2: Implementation
Follow the [javadoc](https://csu-compsci-cs163-4.github.io/Lab12SaladOrder/) and write some code. Make sure to write tests for your code as you work on each method.

## Step 3: Finishing up
To turn in your assignment, click through the link on Canvas, upload your files to Zybooks and click submit for grading. Note you can do this more than once.
