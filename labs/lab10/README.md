## Lab 10 - PizzaOrder
 
## Scenario 
You have been hired to produce an ordering system for a pizza restaurant and will add more code over the span of the next three weeks. For this first week, you will be writing the program
to read in files and build receipts using a provided `Pizza` class.

Here is an example of the receipt you will be able to print to the terminal:

```text
--------------------
PIZZA          17.44
           PEPPERONI
                 HAM
             SAUSAGE
               BACON
           HAMBURGER
--------------------
PIZZA          17.44
          MUSHROOOMS
              ONIONS
        BELL PEPPERS
              OLIVES
            TOMATOES
--------------------
PIZZA          14.46
             CHICKEN
               BACON
          RED ONIONS
--------------------
TOTAL:         49.34

```



## Step 1: Getting Started
Take a look at the [javadoc](https://csu-compsci-cs163-4.github.io/Lab10PizzaOrder/) and take note of the methods you need 
to create/implement. See what code has been provided and what still needs to be done. Brainstorm some ideas on how to implement these methods, and write your thoughts down.

## Step 2: Implementation
Follow the [javadoc](https://csu-compsci-cs163-4.github.io/Lab10PizzaOrder/) and write some code. Make sure to write tests for your code as you work on 
each method.

## Step 3: Finishing up
To turn in your assignment, click through the link on Canvas, upload your files to Zybooks and click submit for grading. Note you can do this more than once.
