# Lab05StrictHousehold

This lab will focus primarily on the use of constructors, setters, getters, and object instances.

For ease of access, here is the [javadoc](https://csu-compsci-cs163-4.github.io/Lab05StrictHousehold/).

## Step 1: Self-Explanation
Answer the following questions on a separate sheet of paper or in the comments of your code:
1. What is a setter?
2. What is a getter?
3. Why do you think we have/use constructors?
4. What do we call the object variables Household has of type Child, Guardian, and Dog?

## Step 2: Implementation
For this assignment, you will see that Household and Guardian have been completed for you. You will need to complete the code in Child and Dog.

## Step 3: Testing
After you have finished writing your code, run the tests in main and ad a few more of your own to test your work.

## Step 4: Turning In
Once finished, be sure to submit your code to Zybooks and make sure to get your self-explanation checked.

# Additional Information
## This keyword
The "this keyword" is a very useful one. When you are working with a local variable and a class variable of the same name, you can use 
```this.variablename```
to specify the class variable. Otherwise the local variable will be assumed. 

You can think of it like this: say you work in an office and the big boss in charge is named Steve. You also have a coworker named Steve. 
When you mention Steve, everyone assumes you are refering to your coworker unless you specify Big Boss Steve, or this.Steve.
